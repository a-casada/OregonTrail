                About the Oregon Trail:
                 The Oregon Trail was a legendary 2170 mile stretch of land from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon.
                 In the early 1800s, the trail was utilized by fur traders, only traveling the tail on horseback.
                 By 1836, wagon trains from Independence, Missouri began clearing the trail to Oregon.\s
                 As the years went on, roads, bridges, and ferries were built to speed up the journey.\s
                 In the 1840's, the Organic Laws of Oregon promised free land to any settlers who chose to move to Oregon.
                 The term "Manifest Destiny" was coined to describe the thousands of families who traveled the trails, inspired by that very promise.
                 Many other families were inspired by the California Gold rush in 1848, inspired from the promise of riches.
                 By the 1860's, many were traveling on ferries, with rivers and canals bring created to aid the pioneers.
                 Finally, in 1869, the transcontinental railroad was completed, leading many to chose it over the trail.

                While natural hazards and dangerous river crossings were very common along the trail, many emigrants feared
                contact with Native Americans. However, this fear was often misplaced, as contact was rare, and not always
                hostile.  The emigrants were far more likely to die from accidents; diseases, such as cholera and typhoid;
                starvation; drowning while attempting a river crossing; or the perils of an unexpected blizzard. The wagon
                trains often encountered grass fires, hailstorms, floods, and other powerful forces of nature.
                                
                At least 27 different Indian tribes lived near the Oregon Trail, with most offering trades with the
                emigrants, and only a small portion choosing to stealing small portions of supplies. Because the emigrants
                were ignorant about Indian cultures, they often behaved in an unnecessarily hostile manner toward the Indians.

                snakebites.The cost of the entire trip, to outfit and transport each family, was about five hundred dollars.
                
                Though there was very little formal schooling, children learned a great deal — from how to care for animals
                to the names of flowers. Women and teenage girls worked extremely hard. In addition to cooking and caring for
                the younger children, they also pitched tents, built fires, drove oxen, protected camp, and assumed other
                traditionally male duties.
                
                Most emigrants walked next to their covered wagons, rather than riding, so that the livestock would have less
                weight to pull, and because there was very little room to sit inside. Firewood was always scarce, and during
                the day, women and children collected weeds and buffalo chips (dung) to use to heat their evening meal.
